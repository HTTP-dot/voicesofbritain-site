Author’s note:
I’m a 20 year old politics student from Scotland. I developed Crisis Masculinity Theory by connecting what I’ve read 
Connell, Zuboff, Kimmel,  with what I’ve seen firsthand: boys radicalised online, group chats full of gender resentment, solidarity breaking down in real time. This is a lived synthesis, not just an academic one. The theory is political because the damage is real and happening now.



Something ugly is blooming in group chats, gaming servers, and college corridors. You hear it when a boy casually calls women “females,” when TikToks rant about “high body counts,” when incel memes slide from ironic to doctrine. The mainstream says young men just got lost, that it’s about fatherlessness or poor role models. Nice idea. Pity it’s wrong. Misogyny today isn’t a glitch in the system. It’s a feature that helps the system survive.

Late capitalism is buckling. Real wages in the UK have flatlined since 2008 while rents have soared by over 25% in real terms. NHS waiting lists are at record highs. Futures feel small, unstable, and hollowed out. For men raised on the promise of permanent progress and inherited importance, that collapse feels personal. Stable jobs that once defined masculinity, like trades, manufacturing, and long-term skilled work, have vanished or become insecure. Family authority dissolves. Community respect is reduced to five-star gig economy ratings. Structural identity collapse leaves young men staring at the ceiling, wondering: what am I for now?

Historically, this kind of psychic freefall produces collective action. Strikes. Civil rights. Revolution. But capitalist systems learn. They know that diffuse rage is dangerous unless it can be redirected. Enter the scapegoating mechanism. Instead of encouraging solidarity, capitalism feeds young men a sleight of handtrick: “The system failed you, sure. But the real enemy? Women. Feminism. Progressives. The ones who laughed while you fell.” You don’t notice the magician’s other hand, the one pocketing the profit.

Misogyny does more than vent frustration. It creates an emotional ideology. Underneath the shock value misogynist content is a seductive story : Women took your power. Feminism rigged the game. Reclaim control and everything will make sense again. It gives disoriented men what capitalism won’t 
a narrative. A villain. A promise. It turns shame into superiority, anxiety into dominance. It’s not just hate, it’s framework for understanding suffering.

And it spreads fast, because it pays. Social media monopolies thrive on cortisol and conflict. In 2024, TikTok’s algorithm pushed #femaleredpill to over 1.2 billion views. Why? Because anger keeps people watching. Misogynist content hits the engagement jackpot: high conflict, lownuance, endlessly viral. Social media platforms pocket the ad revenue, then pretend they’re just mirrors. Traditional media join in, booking abusers for “debates „ inflating toxic views with the credibility of airtime. It’s a feedback loop of rage and cash.

While the algorithm prints money, something more sinister happens: the suppression of solidarity. Workers who might unionise scrap over gender politics. Boys sneer at girls on the picket line. Girls roll their eyes back. The boss smiles. On campuses, a discussion about housing inequality derails into whether “not all men” is a valid rebuttal. Momentum dies. Divide and rule still works - it just wears a podcast mic instead of a crown.

Here’s the key proposition: male radicalisation is not collateral damage. It is profitable and politically useful. It turns potential class rebels into foot soldiers for reaction. And it doesn’t stop with sexism. Misogyny is a gateway drug toward white supremacy, transphobia, anti immigration hysteria. Look at Andrew Tate. His playbook blends toxic masculinity with racial scapegoating and class resentment, monetised through crypto scams and influencer bull. He is a symptom — not a source.

This isn’t a conspiracy. No cabal sat down to design misogyny-as-policy. But capitalism rewards what maintains its power, and punishes what threatens it. That’s how structures function: they shape outcomes as if someone planned them. Misogyny gets oxygen, attention, and cash because it’s useful because it fractures class-based resistance and turns male pain into private resentment, not public action.

Sociologist R.W. Connell called it “hegemonic masculinity” — an identity rooted in dominance, independence, and control. Today, capitalism has rewired that identity to serve profit margins and preserve political passivity. Masculinity isn’t in crisis. It’s being crisis-managed.

So what now?

First, name the structure. If you treat misogyny as an individual failing, you’ll chase your tail forever. Frame it as crisis management for a failing economic order and suddenly the way out changes. Feminism isn’t an add-on to class struggle. It is class struggle. You can’t fight austerity while your group chat’s still sharing Tate clips. Pick a side.

Second, break the algorithm. Platforms don’t just reflect demand..  they manufacture it. Campaigns like StopToxicAds have already exposed how algorithmic recommendation systems are designed to inflame. Push for regulation that removes financial incentives for hate, or fund alternatives where engagement doesn’t mean outrage.

Third, support real world counter narratives. Visibility matters. We need more images of working-class men backing reproductive rights, of women leading rent strikes, of queer organisers front-lining the fight against fascism. These aren’t exceptions they’re suppressed truths. Drag them into the light.

Fourth, build material pathways to dignity. Want fewer alienated boys latching onto hate? Try liveable wages, rent caps, public housing, and universal free education. Men who don’t feel humiliated by their existence don’t need someone else to blame for it. Material conditions write the emotional script 
change the conditions, change the story.

Finally, transform how we teach politicised feeling. Boys are taught that anger is strength and vulnerability is weakness.
Capitalism exploits that script. We need to flip it. Show that care is strength, that solidarity is agency, that resistance requires emotional intelligence. This isn’t soft. It’s strategy.

Some will say this frames men as victims. It doesn’t. It frames them as recruits and gives them the option to defect. This isn’t about coddling boys. It’s about pulling them out of the meat grinder before they become its defenders. Drop the misogyny, and suddenly, you’re useful to the movement. Your pain has context, not just content.

There are already sparks. Delivery riders striking in London. Care workers unionising in Glasgow. School students protesting for Palestine. None of that happens unless people trust each other across gender lines. Misogyny is the weakest link. Break it, and the whole structure tilts.

We need to stop asking why boys are turning hateful and start building a world where hate feels irrelevant. Where it has no social cachet, no economic utility, no algorithmic boost. Where the lads in branded hoodies aren’t mocking the girls instead they’re marching beside them.

That world won’t be easy or free. We’ll have to build it, brick by brick on picket lines, in classrooms, through platforms, through art. Crisis Masculinity Theory isn’t a call to pity. It’s a call to arms. Capitalism taught men to fight women instead of fighting it. Time to break that lesson, smash the classroom, and rewrite the syllabus outside.

We have nothing to lose but clickbait idols and a future worth fighting for to gain.
